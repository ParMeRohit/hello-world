				The mechanical engineering field requires an understanding of core areas including mechanics, dynamics, 
				thermodynamics, materials science, structural analysis, and electricity. In addition to these core 
				principles, mechanical engineers use tools such as computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing 
				(CAM), and product life cycle management to design and analyze manufacturing plants, industrial equipment 
				and machinery, heating and cooling systems, transport systems, aircraft, watercraft, robotics, medical devices, weapons, and others.<br /><br />

              <p>Piping Engineering is basically the designing and construction of fluids and gases through the system of pipes. 
			  It is a very crucial and daunting task to get the piping systems right and can be time consuming too. Piping design 
			  engineers are required from start to end of the job as they have to inspect the site, draw blueprints, design and 
			  manage cost for building as well and also decide on materials to be used. Common example of piping engineering is 
			  found everywhere i.e Plumbing.</p>

              <p>"Nanotechnology is science, engineering, and technology conducted at the nanoscale, which is about 1 to 100 
			  nanometers." This is the most simple and apt definition of Nanotechnology. Recently about 30 years ago the microscopes
			  needed to see things at the nanoscale were invented hence Nanotechnology is the ability to see and to control
			  individual atoms and molecules. Nanotechnology offers the potential for new and faster kinds of computers, more 
			  efficient power sources and life-saving medical treatments.</p>

              <p>After scoring a minimum of 55% in B.tech and completing graduation, a student can
			  pursue M.Tech in Mechanical engineering to obtain a Masters Degree. This is a 2 years
			  program and 3 years if chosen to study part-time. The Fee for Master's in Mechanical 
			  engineering could cost anywhere between 40 Thousand to 1 lacs depending on the Institute.
			  Students who have interest and enjoy the designing, making and installation process of 
			  machines can opt for this course. Masters of Technology in Mechanical engineering teaches 
			  one the in depth knowledge of machines using science and technology.</p>
