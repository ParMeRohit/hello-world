			<p class="mb-5"><font color = "white">The branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, organization, 
			analysis, and interpretation of numerical data. Statistics is especially useful in drawing general conclusions 
			about a set of data from a sample of the data. Used with a plural verb Numerical data.<br /><br />
			Statistical knowledge helps you use the proper methods to collect the data, employ the correct analyses, 
			and effectively present the results. Statistics is a crucial process behind how we make discoveries in 
			science, make decisions based on data, and make predictions.<br /><br />

              <p>
			  Statisticians collect, analyse and interpret data to help solve problems or even get survey results in a company. 
			  This is a numerative calculation using statistical theories and methods on the collected data. To collect data, 
			  Statisticians create polls, surveys and questionnaires. Statistics is required in important fields such as business,
			  engineering, science and other fields to understand the trends and forecast situations. A Statisticians could find jobs
			  in Market research companies, Hospitals, Office for National Statistics (ONS), Industrial, pharmaceutical and
			  commercial companies and other such sectors.
