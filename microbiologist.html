              <p>
			 Industrial Microbiology or microbial biotechnology is the study of microorganisms such as bacteria,
			 fungi, algae, protozoa and viruses or plant and animal cells with the application of scientific and
			 engineering principles to the processing of industrial materials to create useful products or processes. 
			 For example, in the production of high-value products such as drugs, chemicals, fuels and electricity. 
			 An Industrial microbiologist may examine microbial growth found in chemical factories, oversee the microbial 
			 activities used in cheese production to ensure quality or monitor the impact industrial waste has on the local ecosystem.
