			<p class="mb-5"><font color = "black">Civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction,
				and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including public works such as roads, bridges, canals,
				dams, airports, sewerage systems, pipelines, structural components of buildings, and railways.<br /><br />
				Demand for biomedical, civil engineers continues to rise. Employment of civil engineers is projected to grow 20 percent 
				from 2012 to 2022, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. <br /><br /> 
				In summary, Civil engineering would be a good career choice. Any basic engineering field is good for your career at all times. Specifically, 
				civil engineering also has the advantage of getting a government job in almost every sector.<br><br>

			  Building control surveyors are also known as building control officers (BCOs). They guide and give 
			  assistance while building new structures and demolitioning old ones, keeping safety in mind.Building 
			  control surveyors also check the process of construction during and after the completion to ensure
			  that regulatory standards of safety, sustainability, accessibility and design are met. Building control 
			  surveyors are required in every small to big structures, such as extending a private bungalow or building a new shopping mall.

              <p>Computer-aided design systems are used to create design plans for structures such as machines and buildings. 
			  Technician who use this technology is called CAD technician . This technology basically eliminates the age old
			  process of drawing with pen on paper and replaces it with technical drawings using electronic machines. Though it 
			  is computer-aided designing, technicians need to use their mathematical and engineering knowledge along with skills
			  to design buildings, machinery, products and parts.</p>
